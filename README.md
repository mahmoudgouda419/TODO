# Taskify 📝

Taskify is a simple to-do list web app I built to practice JavaScript and improve my front-end skills.
The idea was to create something clean, interactive, and actually useful for organizing daily tasks.

You can add tasks, set their priority, mark them as done, and everything stays saved even after refreshing the page.

* Automatically sort tasks by priority
* Mark tasks as completed

* Tasks stay after refresh

## 📚 What I learned

While building Taskify, I learned:

* How to manipulate the DOM and handle events
* How to manage app state without using frameworks
* How LocalStorage works and how to use it properly
* How to think about UI/UX, not just functionality

This project helped me understand how real front-end apps are built step by step.

## 🚧 Possible improvements

* Edit tasks
* Progress bar for completed tasks
* Dark / light mode
* Drag & drop reordering
* Better mobile support
